The causes of road traffic accidents cover a wide range of external factors, such as weather, road conditions, road types, obstacles, etc., and human factors, such as driver violations or negligence, etc. Therefore, we analyze the accident data to find out the causes of accidents. By informing drivers in advance, we can avoid or pay attention to these accident-prone factors intentionally, so as to reduce the effect of traffic accidents. The system uses the traffic accident data provided by the government's open data platform to classify the accidents that occur at different times of the day and weather, and then uses data visualization to extract the characteristics and analyze the most frequent features that induce accidents. We also analyze the correlation between them and other features. For example, the presence of road depressions, road obstructions, and blurred road edges on a roadway. Combining several accidents that occurred in this area, the most frequent cause of the accident is the roadway obstruction. Then, a correlation study was conducted with blurred pavement boundaries to see if there was a degree of correlation between the two. The prediction results are then marked on the map and combined with the GPS function to notify drivers with voice alerts when they are about to pass through a high accident-prone roadway, noting that this roadway often causes accidents due to certain factors, and recommending low accident-prone roadways for drivers' reference when navigating
